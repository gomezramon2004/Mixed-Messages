# mixedMessages.js

## Project Topic:
In this project a way to randomize a list of messages from different topics and display them will be developed. This project aims to demonstrate the abilities of **Full-Stack** that I’ve acquired during this course.

The software will contain the following functionalities:

- Full **personalized messages** made of three randomized statements.
- Write your **own statements**. It will be saved in a database.
- Display **ASCII art** as a random easter egg!

## What kind of messages do the program will display?

The program will take three statements based on certain criteria:

- First, the initial statement is composed of a noun characterized by an adverb.
- Then, the second statement is composed of a verb reflecting an action.
- Lastly, the last statement is composed of the next phrase: “*… then, suddenly*”. This is created to anticipate a mysterious twist in the tale because it will be finalized with an anti-climatic event.
